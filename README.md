<h2>Todo project</h2>

This project was inspired by my inability to focus and get things done according to their priorities, I am a graphics design and Wordpress web developer and also an IT support in the firm where I work, so all the time I always have issues with scheduling and listing out tasks to be done for a particular day, most times I end up unproductive.

That brought up the idea of creating a todo app, which is focused on listing and checking todo lists as they are completed

The project was solely developed and deployed by me alone. Sigh, it was a rough ride completing the project and fixing bugs. But I stood strong doing hard things is now the slogan

Using MERN stack to complete the project from start to finish isn’t a child’s play especially when you do not have any experience of JavaScript full stack development 

<h3>Talking about the technology behind the website:</h3>

<h4>Front-end Technology</h4>
ReactJs
Material UI library for the user interface
React router dom
Redux

<h4>Back-end Technology</h4>
NodeJs
Mongodb
ExpressJs 

<h4>Authentication</h4>
Jwt web token
Joi
dotenv (.env)

This app is fully responsive and user experience was considered, 
Without creating a user account users cannot create a todo list, edit or access todos

There is a little persistence in the web app, as to even if you refresh your browser page, the token would still be logged in, unless you click the sign out button.

The most difficult part of this web app is the linking the UI with the backend and authentication process, I crashed the app twice because of this and also getting documentations with enough information to write a code without getting bugs or errors 

This project made me realize in brighter light that; whatsoever you set your mind to, you can achieve as long as you give it your all, I appreciate my mentor, a senior colleague also graduated from ALXSE, he guided me and help me fix an error that I’ve been battling with for over four days.
